console RPG

1) build jar [jdk 1.7]<br />
2) run jar in your terminal <br />
works on linux <br />
works on MacOS but repaint of map is too slowly<br />
works on Windows but sometimes your game map will move by vertical<br />

play in terminal because IDE does not support console clean!!! <br />

<br />
Implemented: <br /> 
1) character creation : name, type (sniper, regular soldier) with differents weapon set <br />
2) map exploring : you can walk through forests and fields, and cannot through mountains and rivers  <br />
3) primitive enemies : animals and humans <br />
4) fighting engine : you personage can shoot at any enemy and humans can shoot at you <br />
5) your level will increase after fights and your strike power depends on the level <br />
6) you can find items (but cannot add them into your backpack yet) and you can accidently die

7) a lot of bugs - will be fixed <br />
<br />
TODO <br />
1) bugfixing <br />
2) implement fight animals against personage <br />
3) refactoring, review all the TODOs in the project <br />
4) implement save and load from saved state <br />
5) test on Windows and MacOS <br />
